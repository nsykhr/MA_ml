I’m not surprised: I looked for an example of the ‘’in nomine’’ plainsong notaion and couldn’t find one online - to my astonishment too.  \\n :But maybe you could clear up a question for me: is the cantus firmus of the English ‘’in nomines’’ the plainchant (in the alto part), or one of Taverner’s other three parts? This is not clear to me in the article. If the ‘’in nomines’’ are based on the plainchant, then where does Taverner come into it? Your expertise would be most appreciated, and maybe the article requires some explanation to this effect.   \n",

Greetingshhh!\\n\\nUh, there are two ways, why you do erased my comment about WW2, that holocaust was brutally slaying of Jews and not gays/Gypsys/Slavs/anyone...\\n\\n1 - If you are anti-semitian, than shave your head bald and go to the skinhead meetings!\\n\\n2 - If you doubt words of the Bible, that homosexuality is a deadly sin, make a pentagram tatoo on your forehead go to the satanistic masses with your gay pals!\\n\\n3 - First and last warning, you fucking gay - I won't appreciate if any more nazi shwain would write in my page! I don't wish to talk to you anymore!\\n\\nBeware of the Dark Side!   \n",

Because, as I am most certainly aware, your life is a shitstorm of sitting in front of the computer masturbating to fictional creatures. Your attempts to get rid of me are mediocre at best. You are constantly sucking the dick of failure. You don't want a personal attack, huh? Well, too bad, Fuckcock McDickerson. You've got one. From me. You can go ahead and delete my profile from wikipedia. I'll just make another one and come right back to 'Syrthiss's talk page and insult the dick off of you.

       "58   My Band Page's deletion. You thought I was gone. \\n\\nDeleting the comment I posted on your 'talk page' does not delete my feelings for your hasty decision to delete my page. You, sir, are still a cock-sucking douche fuck. Sit back for a second and think about what your life has become. ............ Done? That didn't take long did it? Nope. Because, as I am most certainly aware, your life is a shitstorm of sitting in front of the computer masturbating to fictional creatures. Your attempts to get rid of me are mediocre at best. You are constantly sucking the dick of failure. You don't want a personal attack, huh? Well, too bad, Fuckcock McDickerson. You've got one. From me. You can go ahead and delete my profile from wikipedia. I'll just make another one and come right back to 'Syrthiss's talk page and insult the dick off of you. How could you shatter the dreams of an innocent eighteen year old college freshman trying to make a name for his band. Does that make you happy? Fucking wit...   \n",

It's fucking insulting. \\n\\nI'd rather deal with an honest asshole (which I would really like to see around here) than a bunch of ass-kissing, arrogant snakes (which I see in spades). This project just goes to hell that little bit further every day; I wonder how long until the articles I've written are bastardised in the way all of these are?  talk \"   \n",

Along Redleaf Ave and the Pacific Hwy, they illegally park. Now, I know a friend who lives on the Pcfc Hwy in Wahroonga, and the snobby bastards from Knox come along and completely block people's driveways. They can't get out! However, it's not illegal and the people of Wahroonga complain to Ku-ring-gai Council and what do they get? Nothing! It's ridiculous that bastards like that can get away with it. Somebody needs to add another section on this article talking about this issue, so that people who want to know more about the school and also people who attend the school can realise just how much arrogant and jerky they are!   \n",
